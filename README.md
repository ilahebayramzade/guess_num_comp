Computer Guess Number Game 🎯

This project is a simple, interesting game that I made to develop my basic concepts with Python and learn programming in a fun way. I hope you will learn and have fun while watching and using it. 😊

📋 About the Project
- Game Logic:
- You think of a number, and the computer guesses that number. - You help the computer guess by giving the answer "bigger", "smaller" or "correct".
- Python Code: All the logic and functions of the game are written using Python.
- HTML Visual: Written with the help of AI to make it more interactive and easy to share with others.

💻 How Does It Work?
1. Start the game and think of a number.
2. The computer will try to guess the number you are thinking of in a row.
3. Tell the computer by saying "bigger" or "smaller" until the number you are thinking of is guessed correctly.

🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x must be installed.

🚀 How to Run?
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_name/computer-guess-number-game.git
cd computer-guess-number-game
